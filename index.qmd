Each day we will have morning (9am – noon) and afternoon (2pm – 5pm) sessions. There will be short coffee breaks
at 10:30am and 3:30pm with coffee and snacks covered by the registration fee. Participants will have to find lunch on their own.

You can attend as many or as few of the courses as you want. All sessions will be in-person at the Big Data
Hub at SFU's main (Burnaby) campus.
